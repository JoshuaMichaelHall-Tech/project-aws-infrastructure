# Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains architecture diagrams for the Financial Infrastructure project.

## Diagrams

### 1. High-Level Architecture
- **File**: `high-level-architecture.png` (to be created)
- **Description**: Overview of the multi-account AWS architecture showing account boundaries, main services, and data flows.

### 2. Network Architecture
- **File**: `network-architecture.png` (to be created)
- **Description**: Detailed VPC design showing subnets, routing, NAT gateways, VPN connections, and network segmentation.

### 3. Security Architecture
- **File**: `security-architecture.png` (to be created)
- **Description**: Security controls including IAM roles, KMS encryption, GuardDuty, Security Hub, and compliance monitoring.

### 4. Data Flow Diagram
- **File**: `data-flow-diagram.png` (to be created)
- **Description**: How data moves through the system, including encryption points and access controls.

### 5. Disaster Recovery Architecture
- **File**: `disaster-recovery.png` (to be created)
- **Description**: Multi-region setup for disaster recovery, backup strategies, and failover procedures.

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline
- **File**: `cicd-pipeline.png` (to be created)
- **Description**: Infrastructure deployment pipeline showing validation, security scanning, and deployment stages.

## Creating Diagrams

Recommended tools for creating architecture diagrams:
- AWS Architecture Icons: https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/
- draw.io / diagrams.net
- Lucidchart
- PlantUML for text-based diagrams
- AWS Architecture Diagramming Tool

## Diagram Standards

1. Use official AWS architecture icons
2. Follow AWS architecture diagram best practices
3. Include a legend for symbols and colors
4. Label all components clearly
5. Show security boundaries and data flows
6. Indicate encryption points
7. Use consistent color coding:
   - Blue: Compute resources
   - Green: Storage resources
   - Orange: Database resources
   - Red: Security boundaries
   - Purple: Monitoring/Management

## PlantUML Examples

For version-controlled diagrams, consider using PlantUML:

```plantuml
@startuml High Level Architecture
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Container.puml

LAYOUT_TOP_DOWN()

Person(user, "Financial Services User", "Uses the financial application")
System_Boundary(aws, "AWS Cloud") {
    Container(alb, "Application Load Balancer", "AWS ALB", "Distributes traffic")
    Container(web, "Web Tier", "EC2 Auto Scaling", "Handles web requests")
    Container(app, "Application Tier", "ECS Fargate", "Business logic")
    Container(db, "Database", "RDS Multi-AZ", "Stores financial data")
    Container(s3, "Object Storage", "S3", "Stores documents")
}

Rel(user, alb, "HTTPS")
Rel(alb, web, "HTTPS")
Rel(web, app, "Internal API")
Rel(app, db, "Encrypted SQL")
Rel(app, s3, "Encrypted S3 API")

## Maintenance

- Update diagrams when architecture changes
- Version control diagram source files
- Export to PNG/SVG for documentation
- Include diagrams in design reviews
