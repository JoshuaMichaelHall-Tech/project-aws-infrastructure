    And S3 access logging must be enabled for sensitive buckets
    And RDS audit logging must be enabled

  Scenario: Data Retention
    Given I have backup configurations
    Then RDS backups must be retained for at least 30 days
    And CloudTrail logs must be retained for at least 365 days
    And S3 objects must have lifecycle policies defined
    And logs must be stored in immutable storage

  Scenario: High Availability
    Given I have production resources
    Then RDS must use Multi-AZ deployment
    And critical applications must span multiple availability zones
    And load balancers must be cross-zone enabled
    And NAT gateways must be deployed in multiple AZs

  Scenario: Security Monitoring
    Given I have security services configured
    Then GuardDuty must be enabled
    And Security Hub must be enabled
    And AWS Config must be enabled
    And CloudWatch alarms must be configured for security events
    And SNS notifications must be configured for critical alerts
