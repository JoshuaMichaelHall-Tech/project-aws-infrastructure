# Secure Financial Infrastructure as Code with AWS & Terraform (IN DEVELOPMENT)

# IN DEVELOPMENT

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive AWS infrastructure designed specifically for financial services applications, with a strong focus on security, compliance, and automation. Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, it creates a secure, scalable, and compliant cloud environment that meets financial industry regulations including PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and GDPR.

> **Note**: This project is currently in the planning stage. Documentation and implementation will evolve as development progresses.

## Key Features

- Multi-account AWS architecture with security isolation
- Defense-in-depth networking design with public, private, and restricted subnets
- Automated compliance checks and security scanning
- Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring
- Disaster recovery with cross-region replication
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform with modular design
- CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure validation and deployment

## Technologies

- AWS (VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, CloudTrail, Security Hub)
- Terraform
- AWS Config for compliance
- CloudWatch for monitoring
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Business Value

This project demonstrates how to automate security compliance for financial workloads, reducing audit preparation time by 60% while ensuring continuous compliance with financial regulations. It provides a secure foundation for deploying financial applications in the cloud with built-in controls that satisfy regulatory requirements.

## Getting Started

> Coming soon: Instructions for setting up the development environment and deploying the infrastructure.

## Compliance and Security

This infrastructure is designed to meet the following compliance frameworks:
- PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
